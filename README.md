# Global Coffee Domestic Consumption Analysis

## Overview
This project involves an end-to-end data analysis of global coffee domestic consumption trends. The analysis identifies key patterns in coffee consumption across different countries and years, utilizing data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques.

## Analysis Workflow
1.  **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preparing the `Coffee_domestic_consumption.csv` dataset for analysis.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating distributions, outliers, and summary statistics to understand the data's structure.
3.  **Visualization**: Creating insightful plots to communicate findings, such as consumption trends over time and comparisons between top consuming nations.
4.  **Reporting**: Documenting the entire process and results in a reproducible PDF report generated from RMarkdown.

## Key Technologies
- **R Programming**: For all data manipulation and analysis.
- **Tidyverse**: Including `dplyr` for data manipulation and `ggplot2` for visualization.
- **RMarkdown**: For generating the final analysis report.

## Files
- `Coffee Consumption Analysis.Rmd`: The RMarkdown source code for the analysis.
- `Coffee-Consumption-Analysis.pdf`: The final report detailing findings and methodology.
- `Coffee_domestic_consumption.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
